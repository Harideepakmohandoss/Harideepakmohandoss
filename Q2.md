An ATM card is a small, rectangular plastic item, typically the size of a credit card, that enables you to access your bank account's funds. It has a variety of features that are designed to make financial transactions easier to perform.

Firstly, each ATM card has a unique set of raised numbers on the front. These numbers are important for identifying your specific card and account. If you run your fingers over the card, you can feel these numbers. There is also a similar set of raised numbers that represent the expiration date of the card. 

On the back of the card, there is a magnetic stripe, which is a dark, smooth strip that stores your account information. When you insert your card into an ATM machine, this stripe is read to identify you and your account.

To use the ATM card, you would insert it into an ATM machine, which has a slot designed to fit the card. The machine will then prompt you to enter a Personal Identification Number (PIN) using the keypad. The keypad typically has raised dots on the number five key to help you orient your fingers. By entering your PIN, you confirm your identity and can then choose various options, such as withdrawing cash, checking your account balance, or depositing money.

If you have trouble seeing the screen, many modern ATMs are equipped with audio assistance. You can plug in your headphones into the provided jack, and the machine will guide you through the transaction using spoken instructions.

An ATM card is a tool that provides you access to your bank account through ATMs. It uses tactile features and sometimes audio assistance to ensure you can perform banking transactions independently and securely.
