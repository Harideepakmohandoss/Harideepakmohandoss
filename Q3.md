Subject: Assistance Required for Smartphone Malfunction
Dear Technical Support Team,
I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to seek assistance with an issue I am experiencing with my smartphone, Model XYZ123.
The problem began two days ago when the screen started flickering intermittently. It has since escalated to a point where the display goes completely black after a few minutes of use, rendering the phone unusable.
To resolve this issue, I have taken the following steps:
Restarted the phone multiple times.
Performed a soft reset by holding the power and volume down buttons simultaneously.
Ensured the operating system is updated to the latest version.
Cleared the cache and performed a factory reset.
Despite these efforts, the problem persists. I suspect it might be a hardware-related issue, possibly the display or a connection inside the device.
I would appreciate guidance on the next steps to diagnose and fix this problem. If you could provide instructions for a potential fix or advise on whether a professional repair is necessary, it would be greatly helpful.
Thank you for your assistance.
Best regards, 
 XYZ.
